# Project Overview
The Boat Clone project is a replica of the official Boat Lifestyle website. This project was created to enhance my front-end development skills and demonstrate my ability to recreate complex, professional websites using core web technologies. The goal was to mirror the aesthetic and functional aspects of the original site, ensuring a similar user experience.

# Objectives

- **Responsive Design:** To create a website that is fully responsive and works seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes.
- **User Interface:** To design an intuitive and visually appealing user interface that closely resembles the original Boat Lifestyle website.
- **Functionality:** To implement interactive elements using Vanilla JavaScript to enhance the user experience.

# Technologies Used
- **HTML:** For structuring the content and layout of the web pages.
- **CSS:** For styling the website and ensuring it is visually appealing. This includes the use of Flexbox and Grid for layout management.
- **Vanilla JavaScript:** For adding interactivity and dynamic features to the website, such as smooth scrolling, navigation menu, and product gallery.

# Key Features
